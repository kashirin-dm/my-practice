# My Practice
Various practical mini-projects for fun and experience

It's my little portfolio
You should not be serious about the quality of the code in these projects

### div-platformer-game
This is really small platformer game on jQuery and simple DIVs. No Canvas, No best-practices.
Stupid and fun.

### to-do-list
Simple TO-DO List on pure JS and LocalStorage.

### honey
A simple SPA based on Vue.js.
A simple reactive form with validation on the client side and a nice adaptive layout base on the Bootstrap 4.

After filling out the form, your comment is sent to Firebase and show the bottom of the page. If something changes in the database, then it also instantly changes on the page.

You can run 'honey/dist/index.html' to try it in action.
